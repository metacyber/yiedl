Hey Developer,

Good to see you here! My name is Vlad and I'm also a developer. How I got to write this article is a different and long story. We'll have time to talk about it later!

I always wanted to change the world and make it a better place. Finally, I opened my eyes and realized that there were many such developers. Developers who want to work on significant technologies and move the boundaries further. But it is not easy to find a right project. You no longer have to wait or look for it!

I'm too humble to say that some project is the perfect one. But the most important thing is not a project. The thing which matters is to get together with other people. Collaboration will always make you stronger and give your ideas wings. The cooperation of skilled people with a vision always has a positive outcome regardless of the initial state.

And the cooperation is what we can do together right now! Yiedl is not a single project. It is more a movement of people and projects with cooperative attitude. It should be a think tank and place where interesting projects, approaches and principles are being developed or discussed. The goal of Yiedl is not to issue a token and fight for it until the end. The general goal is to keep seeking the right direction of decentralization.

We can all be stronger with cooperation. You can become important to your teammates or even the biggest communities in the world. Is it tempting for you? Youâ€™ve now found your developers family!

But, every cooperation costs something. You need to want to learn new things, give cooperation some regular time and contribute actively. On the other hand, you may see great results in a short period of time. You get satisfaction, new skills, you name it... You work on your own projects and get credit for your contribution.

Are you interested in dapps, interoperability, APIs, decentralized storages, data collecting and distributing, mimicables, open knowledge, cryptocurrencies, state channels, atomic swaps, and other technologies? Hop on and change your and others lives forever! 

We can discuss how you can exactly contribute. There is a place for everybody.

Sincerely yours,  
Vlad
